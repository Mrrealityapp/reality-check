    <h2>Support Reality Check</h2>
    <p>
      Reality Check is more than a website — it’s a mission to restore trust and dignity online.
      As a disabled veteran living on disability income and government programs, I’ve built this
      platform to empower vulnerable communities and support charitable projects like Hands of Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your donations don’t just keep Reality Check alive — they also help me and my cat Charlie
      maintain stability and security. Every contribution makes a real difference.
    </p>

    <h3>How You Can Help</h3>

    <h2>Why Your Support Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Reality Check and Hands of Hope were created with a simple purpose: to bring truth, transparency, and compassion into communities that need it most. This mission is deeply personal. As a disabled veteran living on a fixed income of $856 a month, I am building this project not only to uplift others, but also to create a healthier, more stable life for myself so I can continue serving my community.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every donation, subscription, or act of support directly strengthens this mission. Your contribution helps fund the development of Hands of Hope, supports community outreach, and allows me to maintain my health and stability so I can keep building tools that make a real difference.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your generosity doesn’t just help me — it helps every person this project will reach. Thank you for believing in this vision and standing with me as we bring Hands of Hope to life.
